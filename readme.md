The Federal Office Of Statistics in brazil, estimates that the costs for the world cup will ad up to the enormous sum of 11.2 billion US$.

## Introduction 2
Even though soccer is a religion in Brazil, not everybody welcomed the decision of the nation hosting the world cup. As Brazil is still a threshold country, we (like many Brazilians) were wondering if there weren't any better options to invest the money.

## Public transportation
The average wages in Brazil are less than a quarter compared to German salaries. Although public transportation is an important sector in Brazilian everyday life, bus drivers only earn a salary of 553 US$ while the minimum wage guarantees 305 US$. In 2014, a price increase on bus tickets (about 1,35 US$ for a ticket) contributed in protests among the citizens of Rio de Janeiro. Rio now belongs to one of the most expensive Brazilian cities concerning public transportation by bus. Many communters depend on using public transportation and cannot afford higher ticket prices. The visualization shows, how much potential 11.5 Billion US $ have in tackling the biggest issues in brazil.

## Adminstration Staff
Public administration is a big issue in Brasil. Corruption and a lack of qualified staff are causing problems in the distribution of fundings. In 2012 for example, only 27% of the household's budget for health care was spend because the public administration wasn't able to allocate it properly. In the 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index, Brazil scored 43.That meant tying with South Africa and performing more poorly than Cuba. Corruption was one of the issues that lead to the huge civilian protests in 2013. 

## Social Welfare
In 2012, 16% of the brazilian population lived at or below the poverty line. Even though these figures are decreasing, the level of poverty especially in the favelas and the rural areas in Brazil is still astonishing. Additionally, the income inequality in Brazil is still high. With a Gini coefficient of 59,3, Brazil is among the 8 most unequal distributed countries in the world(Germany has 28,3). The average amount of social welfare based on figures by the "Portal da Transparencia" is 48 US$ per month for each person receiving welfare.

## Child Labour (value of educational sponsorships)
Brazil struggles with it's high figures of child labour. Even though education is free in brazil, 3,7% of all children between 5-14 years work at least 18 hours per week. Most of them in the agricultural sector. In 2011, 132k children between 10 and 14 were responsible for the supply of a household without parents. Our calculations show, that based on figures by the "Portal da Transparencia", a sponsorship for the living costs of a child are 52 US$ per month on average. 

## health system (salary of nurses in brazil)
A survey by the polling institute Ibope shows that the public health system in brazil is the most criticized political topic in brazil. The average waiting time for cancer treatment was about 6 month in 2013. Especially in the rural areas of Brazil, health care is still underdeveloped. Based on statistics from accounting firm Deloitte, one additional nurse would cost 1321 US $ per month.

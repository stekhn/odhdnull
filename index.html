					Back in 2007, Brazil was elected to host the FIFA soccer World Cup in 2014. Since then, countless projects were started to ensure that the world cup will be a figurehead for brazil and it's economic growth. Stadiums, training camps, hotels and airports have been build all over the country.

					Even though soccer is a religion in Brazil, not everybody welcomed the decision of the nation hosting the world cup. As Brazil is still a threshold country, we (like many Brazilians) were wondering if there weren't any better options to invest the money.

						<p>A survey by the polling institute Ibope shows that the public health system in brazil is the most criticized political topic in brazil. The average waiting time for cancer treatment was about 6 month in 2013. Especially in the rural areas of Brazil, health care is still underdeveloped. Based on statistics from accounting firm Deloitte, one additional nurse would cost 15852 US $ per year.</p>

					<p>Brazil has difficulties in distributing their household funds because of a lack of staff in public administration. How many Administration Assistants do you think could have been hired in one year with 11.2 billion $?</p>

						</p>
						<p>Public administration is a big issue in Brasil. Corruption and a lack of qualified staff are causing problems in the distribution of fundings. In 2012 for example, only 27% of the household's budget for health care was spend because the public administration wasn't able to allocate it properly. In the 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index, Brazil scored 43.That meant tying with South Africa and performing more poorly than Cuba. Corruption was one of the issues that lead to the huge civilian protests in 2013. Based on statistics from accounting firm Deloitte, one additional administration assistant would cost 8400 US $ per year.

					<p>In 2014, people in Rio de Janeiro protested against high public transportation fees and too few busses in the city. How many bus drivers do you think could have been hired in one year with 11.2 billion $?</p>

						<p>The average wages in Brazil are less than a quarter compared to German salaries. Although public transportation is an important sector in Brazilian everyday life, bus drivers only earn a salary of 553 US$ while the minimum wage guarantees 305 US$. In 2014, a price increase on bus tickets (about 1,35 US$ for a ticket) contributed in protests among the citizens of Rio de Janeiro. Rio now belongs to one of the most expensive Brazilian cities concerning public transportation by bus. Many communters depend on using public transportation and cannot afford higher ticket prices. The visualization shows, how much potential 11.5 Billion US $ have in tackling the biggest issues in brazil.</p>

						<p>In 2012, 16% of the brazilian population lived at or below the poverty line. Even though these figures are decreasing, the level of poverty especially in the favelas and the rural areas in Brazil is still astonishing. Additionally, the income inequality in Brazil is still high. With a Gini coefficient of 59,3, Brazil is among the 8 most unequal distributed countries in the world(Germany has 28,3). The average amount of social welfare based on figures by the "Portal da Transparencia" is 576 US$ per year for each person receiving welfare.</p>
